# RCUDA

This is an R GPU computing package built by Nvidia's CUDA framework, it consists of wrappers of Nvidia's CUBLAS CURAND libraries and self-define CUDA functions. By defining gpu objective in R environment, we want to provide a high performance GPU solution of linear algebra which enables user to keep as much work on GPU side as possible that avoids unnecessary memory operation between CPU and GPU.

## Getting Started



### Prerequisities

R version over 2.1

Nvidia GPU with computing capacity over 2.0


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running


```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
